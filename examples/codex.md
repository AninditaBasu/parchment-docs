## Paragraphs

Meghaduta is a lyric poem written by Kalidasa (c. 4th–5th century CE), considered to be one of the greatest Sanskrit poets. It describes how a _yaksha_, who had been banished by his master to a remote region for a year, asked a cloud to take a message of love to his wife. The poem become well-known in Sanskrit literature and inspired other poets to write similar poems (known as messenger-poems or Sandesha Kavya) on similar themes.

*[yaksha]: N. of a class of demigods who are described as attendants of Kubera, the god of riches, and employed in guarding his gardens and treasures; यक्षोत्तमा यक्षपतिं धनेशं रक्षन्ति वै प्रासगदादिहस्ताः Hariv.; Me.68; Bg.10.23;11.22.
