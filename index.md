# Parchment Docs

---

This is a live demo of the `parchment-docs` GitHub Pages theme. See them in action here:

- [Classic Parchment]({{ '/examples/light.html' | relative_url }}), for the default manuscript look. Light tan with brown ink.
- [Palmleaf Manuscript]({{ '/examples/palmleaf.html' | relative_url }}), for an Indian story. Muted green with plant-ink brown text.
- [Leatherbound Codex]({{ '/examples/codex.html' | relative_url }}), for a dark study or a wizard book. Deep leather brown with gold ink.
- [Vellum Scholar]({{ '/examples/vellum.html' | relative_url }}), for a medieval manuscript look. Cream vellum with blue _rubrication_.
- [Monastery Night]({{ '/examples/monastery.html' | relative_url }}), for a candle-lit desk. Smoky parchment with soot-black ink.
- [Royal Charter]({{ '/examples/charter.html' | relative_url }}), for when you sign death warrants. Formal cream with scarlet red ink.

*[rubrication]: The historical practice in manuscripts and early printing of using a different color (usually red) for titles, headings, initial letters, or important instructions to add emphasis, structure, and decoration, derived from the Latin "rubricare", meaning "to color red".
